Create a git commit for the current changes. Review the staged and unstaged changes, analyze the changes, write a meaningful commit message in the style of previous commits.

If the argument is "staged" ($1 = "staged"), only commit the staged files without adding any additional files. Otherwise, add all files before committing.
